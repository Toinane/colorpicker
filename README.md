applications at the same time.

The Picker allows you to quickly retrieve a color anywhere on the screen. Whether it's on your browser, Photoshop, or
whatever.

Colorsbook is a full-fledged application. It allows you to store your colors, categorize them, and easily retrieve them.
It is destined to mature over time.

With the shades, you can find the perfect color you need. You have a chromatic bar, a natural color bar and a shadow
bar.

This feature is a bit special. It allows you to render the application transparent. This can be useful to see the
appearance of a transparent color.

---

Need to compare a color or clean up the interface? This feature is for you, this will hide the sliders and make the menu
more transparent.

clipboard. This works with hexadecimal and RGB codes

A traditional feature, it allows you to display a color randomly.
