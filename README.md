Colorsbook is a full-fledged application. It allows you to store your colors, categorize them, and easily retrieve them.
It is destined to mature over time.

Need to compare a color or clean up the interface? This feature is for you, this will hide the sliders and make the menu
more transparent.

This functionality is still under development. Currently, it allows you to display the first color that is in your
clipboard. This works with hexadecimal and RGB codes

A traditional feature, it allows you to display a color randomly.
