## About Colorpicker

Colorpicker is a color management software. Grab any color on your computer screen, easily adjust it to your convenience and save it in personalized color categories.

Colorpicker is built on top of **Electron** with modern frameworks and works as well on **Windows**, **Macos** and **Linux**.

## Download

You can download [Colorpicker on the releases page](https://github.com/Toinane/colorpicker/releases).

## Development

#### How to contribute

Colorpicker use **Preact** to make front development easier with components. **Typescript** is also used to be more consistent and get less side effects.

You should use a Code Editor compatible with _Prettier_ and _ESLint_ plugins like **VS Code**.

- Install dependencies

```shell
yarn
```

- Launch Colorpicker in development mode

```shell
yarn dev
```

- Make a Nightly build

```
yarn release:nightly
```

#### How to make stable release

Colorpicker uses **Github Actions** to make a release automatically. This allows to have the application available on all platforms without having to do it manually.

A **Nightly** version is automatically created at each PR merge on `dev` branch and a **Stable** version is automatically created at each PR merge on `master` branch.
